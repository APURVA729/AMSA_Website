<p><b> What is   SCORA ? </b>
 A standing committee on Sexual and Reproductive Health Including HIV and AIDS is a group of passionate individuals who are committed to promote sexual and reproductive health and rights and are dedicated to creating positive change in our local community.

</p>
<p>
<b>
SCORA HISTORY:</b>
In 1992 ,a new working group in IFMSA was formed, named SCOAS(Standing Committee on AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases ). The activities in SCOAS later developed from HIV/STIs advocacy and awareness campaigns, to cover a wide range of reproductive health related issues. This led to a change of focus of the committee in 1998,resulting in a new name : the Standing committee on Reproductive Health including AIDS or SCORA. 
With a large number of members - SCORAngels as they are called - SCORA has grown wide in its work, centered around the 5 focus areas which are strongly related to sexual and reproductive health and rights. In 2004 the name of SCORA changed once more to the Standing Committee on Sexual and Reproductive Health including HIV/AIDS as it is more adequate in terms of topics and problems that SCORA is targeting its action.
</p>
<p>
<b>SCORA focused areas :</b><br>

1.Comprehensive Sexuality Education.<br>
2. Maternal Health and access to safe abortion<br>
3. Sexuality and gender identity.<br>
4. Gender-Based Violence.<br>
