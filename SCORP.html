                <b> HISTORY:</b>
                    In 1983, the Standing Committee on Refugees was formed aiming to call attention to the problems faced by the displaced population and participate in relief efforts. The committee members soon realized that these efforts were merely palliative, whereas a sustainable solution would have to address the root of the problem – violence, conflicts and human rights violations. In 1995, the committee changed the name to Standing Committee on Refugees and Peace, and finally, in 2005 it became the SCORP that we know today, Standing Committee on Human Rights and Peace.
