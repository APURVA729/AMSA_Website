    <p><b>Ideas</b></h1>
        <ul>
<li> The link for  recruitment form should be there as those who are interested can directly fill the form and get re recruited.</li>
<li>The main page should contain a photographic slide show of the past events held in our particular SC.</li>
<li>The content for the website should be in both languages i.e in English as well as in russian . For this a hyperlink should be provided to see the translation, so the locals can also visit the website.</li>
</li>Also a picture of position holder should be there.</li>
